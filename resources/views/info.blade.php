            <h1>Information</h1>

            <p>Graffito allows users to document and share details, images and locations of 
                street art around the city of Toronto.</p>

            <br />

            <!--            <div>The main objective of Graffito is to provide walking tours of street art around 
                        the city while also providing the dual function of acting as a catalogue which 
                        archives past works by location, giving users a way to look back in time. 
                        Graffito also provides the ability for users to share posts on other social 
                        media sites and contribute new entries to the application as new works are 
                        physically created around the city. </div>  -->

            <p>Graffito will take the museum experience outdoors, creating a celebration of 
                street art, the artists and past works in the city of Toronto. </p>
            <br />
            <p>Explore existing entries, Contribute new ones, and Explore Toronto. </p>
